## For whom

- Who wants to refer the seller app.

- You can pick any component of it and use separately.

## Usage

1. Make sure you've pulled all sub-directories .

```
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
```

2. Firebase Authentication.
   - Create the application under [firebase console](http://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Once the application is created, visit the application and click on authentication tab.
   - Enable the following sign methods in the authentication sign-in method tab.
   - In project settings create different projects supported for various platforms like Android, iOS and web, (this will help in downloading the config files, required for authentication)

```
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=”API_KEY”
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=”www.example.com”
```

3. SMTP Requirement

Our seller application requires SMTP configuration to send notification emails either for login one time password, or to recieve welcome emails.

      SMTP_HOST=<SMTP_HOST>
      SMTP_PORT=<SMTP_PORT>
      SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME=<SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME>
      SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD=<SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD>
      SMTP_EMAIL_SENDER=<SMTP_EMAIL_SENDER>

4. S3 Requirement

Our seller application requires S3 configuration as per our implementation to store the assets which we need for application logics.

```
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY>
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY>
  S3_VERSION=<S3_VERSION>
  S3_REGION=<S3_REGION>
  S3_BUCKET=<S3_BUCKET>
```

5. Map My India (MMI)

For location based information, integration with MMI has been used. MMI has been used as follows -
Get detailed address information by typing in search query
Get list of addresses for a given PIN code
Get state and city by PIN code
Get Latitude and longitude of the provided address

MMI API that have been used are as follows -
https://outpost.mapmyindia.com/api
https://atlas.mapmyindia.com/api/places/search/json
https://explore.mappls.com
https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1
https://atlas.mappls.com/api/places/geocode

```bash
  MMI Configuration in the white labeled buyer app
  MMI_CLIENT_SECRET=”MMI_SERVICE”
  MMI_CLIENT_ID=”MMI_CLIENT_ID”
  MMI_ADVANCE_API_KEY=”MMI_ADVANCE_API_KEY”
```

6. Pick the .env file and ask the admin for keys that need to replaced.

- By the use of [signing_and_verification](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/reference-implementations/tree/main/utilities/signing_and_verification) utility, we will get these keys.

```
  Signing_private_key: some-key
  Signing_public_key: some-key
  Crypto_Privatekey: some-key
  Crypto_Publickey: some-key
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- For the white label app, ONDC has used ansible to deploy and generate ssl certificates.
- The public key of the node to generate ssl and make it available for the seller apps to identify the buyer app.
- Docker and docker compose needs to be installed.
- Access to github repository to clone.
- Create a copy of .env-local with valid credentials and name it .env-<stagename>. E.g. .env-prod.

### How to use ansible

First ansible is to install the apps and generate ssl certificate

```
  CMDs (commands)
     ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts buyer-app-install-for-ssl.yaml

  it will ask for
	 Hostname - which needs to be mentioned in hostname file

  it will ask for domain to host
     E.g. buyer-app.ondc.org

  it will ask for stage name, which is used to copy the .env file, to copy
     If a env file of .env-prod is already created, then prod

```

- Try to run to generate lets encrypt ssl certificates

```
ansible-playbook -i seller-app-install-for-ssl.yaml
```

- Once above ansible playbook is successfully installed we can run

```
ansible-playbook -i seller-app-run.yaml

```
